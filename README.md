# Overview

This is a simple TypeScript project that demonstrates a typewriter effect animation in the browser. The application displays "Hello, world" with each letter appearing one at a time, creating a classic typewriting animation effect.

I created this software to practice TypeScript fundamentals and learn how to set up a basic TypeScript development environment. This project helped me understand TypeScript compilation, async/await patterns, and DOM manipulation with type safety.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager

## Installation and Running

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd hello-world
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Build the TypeScript code:

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

4. Open `index.html` in your web browser (simply double-click the file or use your preferred method)

## Development

To automatically rebuild when you make changes:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

# Development Environment

- **Code Editor**: VS Code
- **Package Manager**: pnpm 10.28.0
- **Programming Language**: TypeScript 5.9.3
- **Runtime**: Browser (no server required)

TypeScript is a strongly-typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It provides static type checking, which helps catch errors during development and improves code quality and maintainability.
